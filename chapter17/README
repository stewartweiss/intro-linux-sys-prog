This directory contains demo programs for Chapter 17, which explores methods
of I/O other than blocking reads and writes.  It covers non-blocking terminal
I/O, signal-driven I/O, POSIX asynchronous I/O, and multiplexed I/O.  Some of
the programs aren't included in the book; those that aren't in the book are
marked with *.

None of the programs in this directory are designed to handle job-control
signals such as SIGINT, SIGQUIT, SIGSTOP, SGTSTP, or SIGTERM. If you send
them these signals, their behavior will not be as I describe them to be.
Create signal handlers for them if you want to do this.

The order in which they should be studied is as follows.

nonblock_demo1.c
nonblock_demo2.c
sigio_counter.c
sigio_demo.c
* aio_write_demo.c
cp_aio.c
select_demo.c
